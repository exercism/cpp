# About

In C++, declarations are often separated from definitions.
Declarations are grouped into so-called header files, with the respective implementations placed in source files.
You can think of the header files as an API.
The header file will tell you _what_ a codebase has to offer without going into the details of _how_.

## Header and Source

The most common file extension for header files is `.h`.
Some projects use `.hpp` or skip the extension completely.

The definitions are located in a separate `.cpp` file.
To reunite the parts, the source file starts by _including_ the respective header file.

If you want to write a library called "quick_math" that offers a function "super_root" that you want to use often, the files would look like this:

```cpp
// A file named quick_math.h
#pragma once
namespace quick_math {
    double super_root(double x, int n);
}
```

```cpp
// A file named quick_math.cpp
#include "quick_math.h"
#include <cmath>
double quick_math::super_root(double x, int n) {
    while(n) { x = std::sqrt(x), --n;}
    return x;
}
```

If you need to include a header that is only required by the implementation, the respective `#include` line is only needed in the source file.
Everything that is included in the header is also available in the `.cpp` file, like the `string` library in the example below.
**Attention**: the `;` is needed after the declaration in the header file, but not after the definition in the source file.

~~~~exercism/note
Many C++ exercises on Exercism start with two almost empty files: header and source.
You have to check the `*_test.cpp` file to see the names and namespaces of the expected functions in order to solve the exercise.

## Classes and Headers

Classes can become very complex and their relation to the header / source partition might be confusing.
One possible layout is to keep all the implementation details in the source file and all the declarations and member variables in the header:

```cpp
// A file named robot_flower.h
#if !defined(ROBOT_FLOWER_H)
#define ROBOT_FLOWER_H
#include <string>
namespace robots {
    class Flower {
        private:
            bool needs_water{};
            int size{};
            std::string name{};
        public:
            Flower(std::string name, int size = 0);
            void give_water();
            std::string get_name();
            int get_size();
            void start_next_day();
    };
}
#endif
```

```cpp
// A file named robot_flower.cpp
#include "robot_flower.h"
robots::Flower::Flower(std::string name, int size) {this->name = "Robotica " + name; this->size = size;}
void robots::Flower::start_next_day() {if (!needs_water) ++size; needs_water = true;}
std::string robots::Flower::get_name() {return name;}
int robots::Flower::get_size() {return size;}
```

When the header is used as an API overview, that is where a person would look for information like default values.
The `size` parameter's default of the constructor is therefore handled in the header and not in the implementation.
The definitions in the source file are prefixed with the namespace `robots` and the class type `Flower`.

Another layout option is a _header only_ library, that does not have a `.cpp` file at all:

```cpp
// A file named robot_flower.h
#pragma once
#include <string>
namespace robots {
    class Flower {
        private:
            bool needs_water{};
            int size{};
            std::string name{};
        public:
            Flower(std::string name, int size = 0) {this->name = "Robotica " + name; this->size = size;}
            void give_water() {needs_water = false;}
            std::string get_name() {return name;}
            int get_size() {return size;}
            void start_next_day() {if (!needs_water) ++size; needs_water = true;}
    };
}
```

Projects might use combinations of these layouts and there is a lot of discussion as to what might be the best fit for each use case.

## Include Guards

You may have noticed the `#pragma once` line in the example header file above.
This is called an include guard - and it ensures that the content of the file is included only once during the compilation to avoid errors.
There is another, more complex variation of an include guard that starts with `#ifndef` and ends with `#endif`, that is detailed below.

## Forward Declarations
C++ code is evaluated procedurally.
If you want to use a function, it has to be known to the compiler at the moment of usage.
Sometimes it is not possible to find a linear fashion to lay out the definitions in the source code.
Take a look at the example below:

```cpp
int myFunction(int n) {
    if (n < 10) {
        return n;
    } else {
        return myOtherFunction(n / 10);
    }
}

int myOtherFunction(int m) {
    return myFunction(m / 2);
}
```

When `myFunction` is defined, the compiler does not know about `myOtherFunction` yet.
Unfortunately, the circle-reference problem cannot be solved by switching the order.

C++ offers **forward declarations** to let the compiler know of `myFunction` and `myOtherFunction` before they are defined.
The compiler assumes that the definition will follow at some later point after the declaration.
The next example shows how a forward declaration is used for functions.

```cpp
int myFunction(int n);          // Forward declaration of myFunction
int myOtherFunction(int m);     // Forward declaration of myOtherFunction

// Definition of myFunction
int myFunction(int n) {
    if (n < 0) {
        return 0;
    } else {
        return myOtherFunction(n - 2);
    }
}

// Definition of myOtherFunction
int myOtherFunction(int m) {
    return myFunction(m / 2);
}
```

## Include Guards via ifndef

It does not matter if the same file is included multiple times within a project.
Header files should not contain definitions.
The complete project cannot have the same definition more than once.
This is called the "One definition rule".
It will be enforced by the compiler.

It is easy to avoid multiple unintended inclusions of the same definition with include guards.
They are formed by a special procedure during the compilation stages.
The aim is to only include a file only if a certain variable has not been set and then set it once the file is included.
Often the sequence of this variable is chosen as a variation of the name of the file.
Another method is the generation of a UUID to reduce the risk of accidentally using the sequence twice.
The syntax can be seen below with `MY_HEADER_FILE_H` as a variable.

```cpp
#ifndef MY_HEADER_FILE_H /* any name uniquely mapped to file name */
#define MY_HEADER_FILE_H
// file content
#endif
```

The problem with `#pragma once` is, that pragmas are not an official part of the C++ language and the implementation differs from compiler to compiler.
Many big projects have switched to the simpler pragma method, but a few are still cautious.
