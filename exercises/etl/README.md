# ETL

We are going to do the `Transform` step of an Extract-Transform-Load.

### ETL

Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) is a fancy way of saying, "We have some crufty, legacy data over in this system, and now we need it in this shiny new system over here, so
we're going to migrate this."

(Typically, this is followed by, "We're only going to need to run this
once." That's then typically followed by much forehead slapping and
moaning about how stupid we could possibly be.)

### The goal

We're going to extract some scrabble scores from a legacy system.

The old system stored a list of letters per score:

- 1 point: "A", "E", "I", "O", "U", "L", "N", "R", "S", "T",
- 2 points: "D", "G",
- 3 points: "B", "C", "M", "P",
- 4 points: "F", "H", "V", "W", "Y",
- 5 points: "K",
- 8 points: "J", "X",
- 10 points: "Q", "Z",

The shiny new scrabble system instead stores the score per letter, which
makes it much faster and easier to calculate the score for a word. It
also stores the letters in lower-case regardless of the case of the
input letters:

- "a" is worth 1 point.
- "b" is worth 3 points.
- "c" is worth 3 points.
- "d" is worth 2 points.
- Etc.

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to transform the legacy data
format to the shiny new format.

### Notes

A final note about scoring, Scrabble is played around the world in a
variety of languages, each with its own unique scoring table. For
example, an "E" is scored at 2 in the MƒÅori-language version of the
game while being scored at 4 in the Hawaiian-language version.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have read the [Installing](https://exercism.io/tracks/cpp/installing) and 
[Running the Tests](https://exercism.io/tracks/cpp/tests) pages for C++ on exercism.io. 
This covers the basic information on setting up the development
environment expected by the exercises.

## Passing the Tests

Get the first test compiling, linking and passing by following the [three
rules of test-driven development](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheThreeRulesOfTdd).
Create just enough structure by declaring namespaces, functions, classes,
etc., to satisfy any compiler errors and get the test to fail.  Then write
just enough code to get the test to pass.  Once you've done that,
uncomment the next test by moving the following line past the next test.

```C++
#if defined(EXERCISM_RUN_ALL_TESTS)
```

This may result in compile errors as new constructs may be invoked that
you haven't yet declared or defined.  Again, fix the compile errors minimally
to get a failing test, then change the code minimally to pass the test,
refactor your implementation for readability and expressiveness and then
go on to the next test.

Try to use standard C++11 facilities in preference to writing your own
low-level algorithms or facilities by hand.  [CppReference](http://en.cppreference.com/)
is a wiki reference to the C++ language and standard library.  If you
are new to C++, but have programmed in C, beware of
[C traps and pitfalls](http://www.slideshare.net/LegalizeAdulthood/c-traps-and-pitfalls-for-c-programmers).
