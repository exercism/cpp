# Hints

## General

- Do not change the code in the families' namespaces.
- Do not copy the values into your code, call the functions.

## 1. Take your seat in front of the families and lay out your papers

- The namespace has to be called `estate_executor` for the tests to work.

## 2. Find the secret account number

Each `bank_number_part` has to be called with the `secret_modifier` from the parameter list.

## 3. Last step: Enter the secret code

- You can call functions from nested namespaces like this `outer_namespace::inner_namespac::my_function`.

- Take care to add the blue and the red fragments separately before multiplicating both parts.
