# Hints

## General

- Do not change the code in the families' namespaces.
- Do not copy the values into your code, call the functions.

## 1. Define a Namespace for the executor of estate functions

- The namespace has to be called `estate_executor` for the tests to work.

## 2. Define a function that assembles the secret account number

 Each `bank_number_part` has to be called with the `secret_modifier` from the parameter list.

## 3. Define a function that assembles the secret code

- You can call functions from nested namespaces like this `outer_namespace::inner_namespac::my_function`.

- Take care to add the blue and the red fragments separately before multiplicating both parts.
