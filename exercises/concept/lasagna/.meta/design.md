# Design

## Learning objectives

- Know what a variable is
- Know how to declare and initialize a variable
- Know how to update a variable
- Know how to call a function
- Know how to return a value from a function
- Know how to define an integer
- Know how to use mathematical operators on integers
- Know how to define single- and multiline comments

## Out of scope

- Naming rules for identifiers
- Memory and performance characteristics
- Method overloads
- Optional parameters
- Classes
- Organizing functions in namespaces
- Organizing code in different files
- Organizing code with header files

## Concepts

- `basics`: know what a variable is; know how to declare and initialize a variable; know how to update a variable; know how to call a function; know how to return a value from a function; know how to define an integer; know how to use mathematical operators on integers; know how to define single- and multiline comments. The following sub-concepts are included `variable declaration`, `variable initialization`, `calling functions`, `comments`

## Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites.

## Analyzer

This exercise could benefit from the following rules added to the [analyzer][analyzer]:

- Verify that the `remainingOvenTime()` method calls the `ovenTime()` method.
- Verify that the `elapsedTime()` method calls the `preparationTime()` method.
