# Hints

## General

- Don't forget the `;` after each statement.
- You can define an integer with `int myInteger = 44;`. 

## 1. Get the time that is spent baking.

- The introduction has information on the time for the recipe.
- A method can return a value in the form of `return 2;`

## 2. Get the preparation time.

- You can access the number of layers by using the respective parameter.
- You can do calculations when you define an integer: `int myInteger = 3 + myOtherInteger;`

## 3. Calculate the time left in the oven

- You can call other methods and use them like variables: `return 22 * myOtherCalculation();`

## 4. Calculate the total time spend on the lasagna

- The output should combine the time for the preparation and the time the lasagna has already been in the oven.
