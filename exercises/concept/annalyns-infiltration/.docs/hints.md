# Hints

## General

- There are three [boolean operators][logical operators] to work with boolean values.
- Multiple operators can be combined in a single expression.

## 1. Check if a fast attack can be made

- The logical NOT operator (`!`) can be placed before an expression to negate its value.

## 2. Check if the group can be spied upon

- Logical operators are typically used to evaluate whether two or more expressions are true or not true.

## 3. Check if the prisoner can be signaled

- Logical operators execute in the order of their precedence (from highest to lowest): `!`, `&&`, `||`.
- For more details check out the [explanation in the reference][logical operators] and the [wiki article about truth tables][truth table].
