# Hints

## 1. Create the Alien Class

- The `constructor` does not have a return type and has the same name as the `class`.
- Usually, the names of `classes` start with a capital letter.

## 2. The `hit` Method

- Remember the invariant: health points can't be negative.

## 3. The `is_alive` Method

- life points at `0` is the only 'dead' condition.

## 4. The `teleport` Method

- Member variables can be updated from any method from within the class.

## 5. The `collision_detection` Method

- All `public` members variables can be called and changed from other classes.
