# Hints

## 1. Create the `Alien` Class

- The `constructor` does not have a return type and has the same name as the `class`.
- A common convention for `classes` is using names in __PascalCase__.

## 2. The `hit` Function

- Remember the invariant: health points can't be negative.

## 3. The `is_alive` Function

- life points at `0` is the only 'dead' condition.

## 4. The `teleport` Function

- Member variables can be updated by any function of the class.

## 5. The `collision_detection` Function

- All `public` member variables can be accessed from outside the class.
