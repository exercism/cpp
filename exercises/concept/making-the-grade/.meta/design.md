# Design

## Goal

This concept exercise should convey a basic understanding of how to handle the `for` loop and `while`.
This concept exercise should also teach how to interrupt or change the normal flow of a loop using the `break`, `return`, and the `continue` statement.

## Learning objectives

- use `while` to make a loop: execute something as long as an expression/test is `true`
- understand the differences between `while` (indefinite, condition-dependent) and `for` (definite, length, or count dependent) loops
- use `break` statement to terminate the nearest enclosing loop
- use `continue` statement to continue with the next cycle of the nearest enclosing loop

## Out of scope

- for each

## Concepts

- `while` loops
- `for` loops
- `break` statement
- `continue` statement

## Prerequisites
