# Design

## Learning objectives

- Know how to write integer literals.
- Know how to write floating point literals.
- Know their underlying type (double precision).
- Know how to truncate floating point numbers (via cast to int or `cmath` header)
- Know how to convert floats to integers.

## Out of scope

- Parsing integers and floats from strings.
- Converting integers and floats to strings.

## Concepts

- `numbers`

## Prerequisites

- `includes`

## Analyzer

- assert that `monthly_rate` calls `apply_discount`
- assert that `monthly_rate` calls `daily_rate`
- assert that `days_in_budget` calls `apply_discount`
- assert that `days_in_budget` calls `daily_rate`
