# Instructions

A local school near you has a very active students' association.
The students' association is managed by a president and once every 2 years,
elections are run to elect a new president.

In this year's election, it was decided that a new digital system to
count the votes was needed. The school needs your help building this new system.

## 1. Get the number of votes from an `ElectionResult`

The new system will need a way to get the number of votes from a counter.

The election result struct is already created for you and it's defined as:

```cpp
struct ElectionResult {
    // Name of the candidate
    std::string name{};
    // Number of votes the candidate has
    int votes{};
};
```

As all members in the `struct` are public, you don't need to write a `constructor` to initialize an `ElectionResult` object. 
You can use an `initializer list` instead:

```cpp
ElectionResult hamilton{"Alex", 1804};
// => the hamilton object was intialized with the name "Alex" and 1804 votes.
```

Create a function `vote_count` that will take a reference to an `ElectionResult` as an argument and will return the number of votes in the `ElectionResult`.

```cpp
vote_count(hamilton);
// => 1804
```

## 2. Increment the votes of an `ElectionResult`

It's finally time to process the votes!
Now you need a way to increment the votes in an `ElectionResult`.

Create a `void` function `increment_vote_count` that will take a reference to an `ElectionResult` as an argument and a number of votes, and will increment the `ElectionResult` by that number of votes.

```cpp
ElectionResult burr{"Aaron " 1801};

increment_vote_count(burr, 3);

vote_count(burr);
// => 1804
```

## 3. Vote counting and Presidency 

The school handed in their votes and it is now time to check the results for the winner.

Create a function `determine_result` that receives a reference to a final count and returns a reference to the `ElectionResult` of the new president.
It should also change the name of the winner by prefixing it with "President". 
The final count is given in the form of a `reference` to `std::vector<ElectionResult>`, a vector with `ElectionResults` of all the participating candidates.

```cpp
ElectionResult sanchez{"Pedro", 471};
ElectionResult wheatley{"Summer", 340};
std::vector<ElectionResult> final_count{sanchez, wheatley};

ElectionResult& winner = determine_result(final_count);

winner.name;
// => "President Pedro"
```

To keep things simple, you can assume the following:
- The `vector` has at least one element.
- There will be no ties for first place.
