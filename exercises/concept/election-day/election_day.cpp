// vote_count takes a reference to an `ElectionResult` as an argument and will
// return the number of votes in the `ElectionResult.


// TODO: Task 2
// increment_vote_count takes a reference to an `ElectionResult` as an argument
// and a number of votes (int), and will increment the `ElectionResult` by that
// number of votes.


// TODO: Task 3
// determine_result receives the reference to a final_count and returns a
// reference to the `ElectionResult` of the new president. It also changes the
// name of the winner by prefixing it with "President". The final count is given
// in the form of a `reference` to `std::vector<ElectionResult>`, a vector with
// `ElectionResults` of all the participating candidates.
