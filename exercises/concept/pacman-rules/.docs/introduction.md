# Introduction

Booleans in C++ are represented by the `bool` type.
A `bool` is either `true` or `false`.

## Logical Operators

C++ supports three boolean operators: `!` (NOT), `&&` (AND), and `||` (OR).
You can also use the alternative versions `not`, `and`, and `or`.

```cpp
true || false // => true
true && false // => false
!true // => false
not false // => true
```

## Precedence

The three boolean operators each have different _operator precedence_.
As a consequence, they are evaluated in this order: `!` first, `&&` second, and finally `||`.
If you want to force a different ordering, you can enclose a boolean expression in parentheses (ie. `()`), as the parentheses have even higher operator precedence.

```cpp
!true && false   // => false
!(true and false) // => true
```

## Conversion

If you use `true` or `false` in a place where a number is expected, they will be converted to  `1` and `0` respectively.
If you use a number in a Boolean operation, everything except `0` is treated as `true` - even negative values.

```cpp
!true && 0.0   // => false
true + true + false // => 2
```
