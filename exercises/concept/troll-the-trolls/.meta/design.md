# Design

## Learning objectives

- Know what an enumeration is.
- Know what a scoped enumeration is.
- Know how to define an enumeration.
- Know that an enum can be converted to an integer.
- Know about the switch statement.

## Out of scope

As this is an advanced exercise, there are no enum-related things that we should explicitly _not_ teach.

## Concepts

- `enums`
- `switch`
- 
## Prerequisites

This exercise's prerequisites Concepts are:

- `classes`
- `comparisons`

## Representer

This exercise does not require any specific representation logic to be added to the representer.

## Analyzer

This exercise could benefit from having an analyzer that can comment on:

- Suggesting to cast to `int` to compare easily between priorities.
