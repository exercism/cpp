        if (signal & reverse) {action = actions.size() - 1; action_incr = -1; end = -1;}        
            
        for (; action != end; action += action_incr)
            if (signal & (1 << action))

```

This approach starts by defining a [`const`][const] `vector` to hold the action values in their normal order.
The value of `16` is defined as a `const` with a meaningful name so it won't be used as a [magic number][magic-number].
The values are defined within an unnamed namespace.
The `static` keyword used to be used for this, but it was deprecated for this purpose in former versions (and then was later undeprecated.)
Many coders still prefer using the unnamed namespace.

The output `vector` is defined, and then variables are defined that control iterating through the actions `vector`, setting their values to iterate in the normal order.

The [bitwise AND operator][bitwise-operators] is used to check if the input signal contains the action for reversing the order of the other actions.

For example, if the number passed in is `19`, which is `10011` in binary, then it is ANDed with `16`, which is `10000` in binary.
The `1` in `10000` is also at the same position in `10011`, so the two values ANDed will not be `0`.
- `10011` AND
- `10000` =
- `10000`

If the number passed in is `3`, which is `00011` in binary, then it is ANDed with `16`, which is `10000` in binary.
The `1` in `10000` is not at the same position in `00011`, so the two values ANDed will be `0`.
- `00011` AND
- `10000` =
- `00000`

If the signal passed in contains the action for reverse, then the iteration variables are set to iterate backwards through the `vector` of actions.

The `for` loop begins.

Normal iteration will start at index `0`.
Reverse iteration will start at index `3`.

Normal iteration will terminate when the index equals `4`.
Reverse iteration will terminate when the index equals `-1`.

Normal iteration will increase the index by `1` for each iteration.
Reverse iteration will decrease the index by `1` for each iteration.

For each iteration of the `for` loop, the AND operator is used to check if the number passed in contains `1` shifted left (`<<`) for the number of positions as the value being iterated.
It uses the falsiness of `0` and the truthiness of any value other than `0`.

```cpp
for (; action != end; action += action_incr)
    if (signal & (1 << action))
        output.emplace_back(actions[action]);
```

For example, if the number being iterated is `0`, then `1` is shifted left `0` times (so not shifted at all), and the signal passed in is ANDed with `00001`.
If the signal passed in is `3`, which is `00011` in binary, then it is ANDed with `00001`.
`00011` ANDed with `00001` is not equal to `0` (so not `false`), so the action at the index of the `vector` of actions is added to the output `vector`.
The index used is the number being iterated, which is `0`, so the element at index `0` (`"wink"`) would be added to the output `vector` using the [emplace_back][emplace-back] function.

If the number being iterated is `1`, then `1` is shifted left `1` time, and the signal passed in is ANDed with `00010`.
If the signal passed in is `3`, which is `00011` in binary, then it is ANDed with `00010`.
`00011` ANDed with `00010` is not equal to `0` (so not `false`), so the action at the index of the `vector` of actions is added to the output `vector`.
The index used is the number being iterated, which is `1`, so the element at index `1` (`"double blink"`) would be added to the output `vector`.

If the signal passed in ANDed with the number being iterated is equal to `0`, then the `action` in the `vector` for that index is not added to the output `vector`.

After iterating through the `vector` of actions is done, the output `vector` is returned from the function.
