This exercise uses the [vector container][vector].
You might find it useful to use the [algorithm][algorithm] header to solve this exercise.
The last tests check for [immutability][immutability].
None of the functions that you are tasked to write should change the scores of the game.

If you want some extra practice, you can implement a function that adds new scores to the game.
