# Crypto Square

Implement the classic method for composing secret messages called a square code.

Given an English text, output the encoded version of that text.

First, the input is normalized: the spaces and punctuation are removed
from the English text and the message is downcased.

Then, the normalized characters are broken into rows.  These rows can be
regarded as forming a rectangle when printed with intervening newlines.

For example, the sentence

```text
"If man was meant to stay on the ground, god would have given us roots."
```

is normalized to:

```text
"ifmanwasmeanttostayonthegroundgodwouldhavegivenusroots"
```

The plaintext should be organized in to a rectangle.  The size of the
rectangle (`r x c`) should be decided by the length of the message,
such that `c >= r` and `c - r <= 1`, where `c` is the number of columns
and `r` is the number of rows.

Our normalized text is 54 characters long, dictating a rectangle with
`c = 8` and `r = 7`:

```text
"ifmanwas"
"meanttos"
"tayonthe"
"groundgo"
"dwouldha"
"vegivenu"
"sroots  "
```

The coded message is obtained by reading down the columns going left to
right.

The message above is coded as:

```text
"imtgdvsfearwermayoogoanouuiontnnlvtwttddesaohghnsseoau"
```

Output the encoded text in chunks that fill perfect rectangles `(r X c)`,
with `c` chunks of `r` length, separated by spaces. For phrases that are
`n` characters short of the perfect rectangle, pad each of the last `n`
chunks with a single trailing space.

```text
"imtgdvs fearwer mayoogo anouuio ntnnlvt wttddes aohghn  sseoau "
```

Notice that were we to stack these, we could visually decode the
ciphertext back in to the original message:

```text
"imtgdvs"
"fearwer"
"mayoogo"
"anouuio"
"ntnnlvt"
"wttddes"
"aohghn "
"sseoau "
```

## Getting Started

Make sure you have read the [Installing](https://exercism.io/tracks/cpp/installation) and
[Running the Tests](https://exercism.io/tracks/cpp/tests) pages for C++ on exercism.io.
This covers the basic information on setting up the development
environment expected by the exercises.

## Passing the Tests

Get the first test compiling, linking and passing by following the [three
rules of test-driven development](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheThreeRulesOfTdd).
Create just enough structure by declaring namespaces, functions, classes,
etc., to satisfy any compiler errors and get the test to fail.  Then write
just enough code to get the test to pass.  Once you've done that,
uncomment the next test by moving the following line past the next test.

```C++
#if defined(EXERCISM_RUN_ALL_TESTS)
```

This may result in compile errors as new constructs may be invoked that
you haven't yet declared or defined.  Again, fix the compile errors minimally
to get a failing test, then change the code minimally to pass the test,
refactor your implementation for readability and expressiveness and then
go on to the next test.

Try to use standard C++11 facilities in preference to writing your own
low-level algorithms or facilities by hand.  [CppReference](http://en.cppreference.com/)
is a wiki reference to the C++ language and standard library.  If you
are new to C++, but have programmed in C, beware of
[C traps and pitfalls](http://www.slideshare.net/LegalizeAdulthood/c-traps-and-pitfalls-for-c-programmers).
