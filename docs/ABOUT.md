[C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) (pronounced `cee plus plus`) is a widely used, compiled, multi-paradigm language that extends
the basic features found in C. Originally created by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs, it is often used in places where speed and very fine
grained control over a program's execution are needed. It is most often found in use as a systems language, and is also great for
situations where resources are significantly constrained. The standard for C++ is maintained by the International Organization for
Standardization (ISO), and the current version of C++ as of December 2014 is C++14 (named not as the 14th version of C++, but rather
signifying that the standard was ratified in 2014).
