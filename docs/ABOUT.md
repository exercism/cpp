[C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) (pronounced cee plus plus) is a general purpose programming language developed by [Bjarne Stroustrup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bjarne_Stroustrup) starting in 1979 at Bell Labs. It is  immensely  popular,  particularly for  applications  that  require  speed  and/or  access to  some low-level  features.  It is considered to be an intermediate level language, as it encapsulates both high and low level language features.

C++ supports [procedural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming), [object-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming), [functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) and [generic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_programming) programming. Compilers for C++ are available for essentially every platform, including Windows, Mac OS, and Linux.

Key Benefits:
- **Type safety:** Encapsulate necessary unsafe operations
- **Resource safety:** Not all resource management is managing memory
- **Performance:** For some parts of almost all systems, it's important
- **Predictability:** For hard and soft real-time systems
- **Teachability:** Complexity of code should be proportional to the complexity of the task
- **Readability:** People and machines ("analyzability")
- **Direct map to hardware:** of instructions and fundamental data types
- **Zero-overhead abstraction:** Classes with constructors and destructors, inheritance, generic programming, functional programming techniques

The standard for C++ is maintained by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), and the current version of C++ as of June 2018 is C++17 (named not as the 17th version of C++, but rather signifying that the standard was ratified in 2017).

The best thing about C++ is that it runs on everything from embedded processors with very limited resources to the largest mainframe supercomputer and every personal computer in between.
